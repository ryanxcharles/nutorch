# Experiment 1: The symlink

## Description

`nutorch` becomes a symlink to `torch` wherever the binaries are installed. One
experiment, three install paths plus docs.

**Decisions, made here:**

1. **`scripts/install.sh`**: after copying the binaries,
   `ln -sf torch "$PREFIX/bin/nutorch"` (relative target — the pair moves
   together); the final verification line also runs
   `"$PREFIX/bin/nutorch" --version`.
2. **`dist/nutorch.rb`**: `bin.install_symlink "torch" => "nutorch"` after the
   existing `bin.install`; the `test do` block gains
   `assert_match "nutorch #{version}", shell_output("#{bin}/nutorch --version")`.
   (The published tap copy is NOT updated — next release; recorded in the issue
   spine.)
3. **The user's live install gains it now**: the brew keg's bin gets the symlink
   locally (`ln -s torch` in the keg, plus the matching link in
   `$(brew --prefix)/bin`) — explicitly recorded as a hand-applied convenience
   that the NEXT RELEASE's `brew upgrade` makes official (the published tap is
   untouched until then). Honesty caveat (review catch): the hand-made prefix
   link is untracked by brew — orphaned by `brew uninstall` and possibly needing
   manual removal before the next release's relink.
4. **Docs touch**: install-from-source page says both names install; the README
   install section gets one clause. No hero/landing changes — `torch` remains
   the canonical name in examples (PyTorch fidelity).
5. **No Rust changes**: nothing reads `argv[0]`; the sibling daemon lookup
   (`current_exe().parent()`) is direction-proof because the link lives in the
   same directory as its target.

## Changes

1. **`scripts/install.sh`**: symlink + verification line.
2. **`dist/nutorch.rb`**: `bin.install_symlink` + test assertion.
3. **`website/src/content/docs/install-from-source.md`** + **`README.md`**: one
   line each.
4. **Local convenience**: keg + brew-prefix symlinks on this machine.
5. **No Rust; no `v1/`; published tap untouched (recorded).**

## Verification

1. **From-source path**: run `scripts/install.sh` into a TEMP prefix;
   `<prefix>/bin/nutorch --version` prints the version;
   `nutorch tensor
   '[1,2]' | nutorch value` works end to end with a private
   TMPDIR (the sibling daemon spawn proves unaffected by the symlink). This is
   the MPS dev-machine gate; the formula's `test do` stays GPU-free via
   `--version`, consistent with the existing block.
2. **Formula**: `brew style` exercised against the NEW line by temporarily
   copying `dist/nutorch.rb` over the local tap's formula copy (uncommitted,
   never pushed), running style, and reverting (review catch — styling the tap's
   old copy would not test the new line); no new offenses; the formula diff is
   exactly the two declared lines.
3. **The live machine**: `which nutorch` resolves in a fresh shell;
   `nutorch daemon status` round-trips against the daemon spawned by `torch`
   (same socket — they are the same binary).
4. **Docs**: website builds clean; `check:content`/`check:links` green; dprint
   clean on touched md.
5. **Hygiene**: no Rust diffs (`git status` proves it); `v1/` untouched.

**Pass** = all five. **Fail** = the symlinked name fails to spawn or find the
daemon, or any installer leaves a dangling link.

## Design Review

**Reviewer:** `adversarial-reviewer` subagent (fresh context, read-only).
**Verdict: APPROVED (first pass).** The reviewer verified the load-bearing
claims against the source: the sibling daemon lookup is genuinely
direction-proof across all three install layouts (from-source prefix, brew keg,
brew-prefix binstubs — every possible `current_exe()` resolution lands in a bin
containing `nutorchd`); nothing in torch-cli reads `argv[0]`; `install.sh`
already takes a prefix argument (gate 1 feasible);
`bin.install_symlink "torch" => "nutorch"` is the correct target=>link DSL and
`brew link` propagates keg symlinks like any binstub. Two Optionals folded: gate
2 now tests the NEW formula line by temporarily copying `dist/nutorch.rb` over
the local tap copy (style against the old copy would prove nothing), and
decision 3's honesty gap closed (the manual prefix link is brew-untracked —
orphaned on uninstall; "next release's upgrade," not "next upgrade," makes it
official). Nit folded: gate 1 named as the MPS dev-machine gate, with the
formula test staying GPU-free.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

`nutorch` answers on the command line — one symlink, three layouts.

- **From-source**: `install.sh` into a temp prefix produced
  `bin/nutorch -> torch`; both `--version` lines print;
  `nutorch tensor '[1,2]' | nutorch value` → `[1.0,2.0]` with a private TMPDIR —
  the symlinked name spawned its sibling `nutorchd` exactly as the design argued
  it would.
- **Formula**: `bin.install_symlink "torch" => "nutorch"` + the GPU-free
  `test do` assertion added to `dist/nutorch.rb`. `brew style` exercised against
  the NEW line via a temporary copy over the local tap formula (then restored,
  tap git-clean): the only offense is the PRE-EXISTING `std_cargo_args`
  suggestion — nothing new. Published tap untouched, as scoped.
- **The live machine**: keg symlink + prefix symlink created by hand; `torch`
  made a tensor, `nutorch daemon status` answered from the SAME daemon (same
  socket, same binary), `nutorch daemon stop` stopped it. Recorded: the keg link
  is visible to `brew list` but is not part of the install receipt — both links
  are hand-applied, orphaned by `brew uninstall`, and official only from the
  next release's upgrade.
- **Docs**: install-from-source page and README each carry one line naming both
  CLI names; `torch` stays canonical in all examples.
- **Gates**: website build + check:content + check:links green; dprint clean;
  ZERO `.rs` diffs (git-verified); `v1/` untouched.

## Conclusion

The project's name now summons the project. The symlink approach cost four lines
across two installers and survived every layout the reviewer enumerated. The
published tap and bottle pick the link up with the next release — the recorded
follow-up shared with the MIT license metadata.

## Result Review

**Reviewer:** `adversarial-reviewer` subagent (fresh context), reviewing BEFORE
the result commit. **Verdict: APPROVED — no Required findings.** The reviewer
reproduced gate 1 independently (temp-prefix install → `bin/nutorch -> torch` →
`[1.0,2.0]` round-trip → daemon stop), confirmed the diff is exactly the six
expected files with zero `.rs` changes, verified the formula DSL and the
UNCHANGED published tap (raw GitHub curl; local tap git-clean), confirmed both
live-machine links and the plan-only plan commit, and re-ran the brew style
temp-copy check — the two new lines add zero offenses (the lone formula-content
offense remains the pre-existing `std_cargo_args`; standalone-style Sorbet
warnings are path-mode artifacts unrelated to this change). One Nit folded:
"brew untracked" softened — the keg link IS visible to `brew list` but is not in
the install receipt, which is the operative fact for uninstall orphaning.
