# Experiment 1: The vendor-autoload stub

## Description

`brew install nutorch` makes `nutorch` work in every new Nushell session with
zero user configuration. The mechanism is Nushell's vendor autoload: Nushell
sources every `.nu` file in `$nu.vendor-autoload-dirs` at startup, and the
brew-built Nushell pins that list to the same `HOMEBREW_PREFIX` every formula
installs into — the prefix-relative contract recorded in the issue spine. The
formula ships a one-line stub there; the stub `use`s the module; the user types
nothing.

**Decisions, made here:**

1. **The formula writes the stub at install time** (it is not in the source
   tarball — `install` generates it):
   ```ruby
   (share/"nushell/vendor/autoload/nutorch.nu").write <<~EOS
     use "#{opt_pkgshare}/nutorch.nu" *
   EOS
   ```
   `opt_pkgshare` (`$(brew --prefix)/opt/nutorch/share/nutorch`) is the
   version-stable path brew maintains across upgrades — the stub never goes
   stale on version bumps, and works even while the keg is unlinked. The
   `test do` block gains an existence assertion for the stub (GPU-free, no
   Nushell dependency — actually RUNNING Nushell stays out of the formula test;
   the live gate below covers behavior).
2. **The end-to-end proof is a real reinstall on this machine**: remove the
   hand-placed stub from the previous session (it would collide with brew's link
   step), temp-copy `dist/nutorch.rb` over the local tap's formula (uncommitted,
   never pushed),
   `brew reinstall --build-from-source
   nutorch/nutorch/nutorch` (the install
   method runs with the NEW formula against the pinned v0.1.0 tarball — the stub
   is install-time output, so no new release is needed to prove it), then
   `nu -c "nutorch tensor
   '[1,2]' | nutorch value"` in a fresh
   non-interactive Nushell with a private TMPDIR. The local tap file is reverted
   afterward (tap git-clean; published tap untouched until the next release, per
   the spine).
3. **From-source installs get the documented fallback, not an imposed one**:
   `install.sh` PRINTS the one-liner for `$nu.user-autoload-dirs`
   (`~/.config/nushell/autoload/nutorch.nu` by default) instead of writing into
   the user's config — an installer that edits shell config uninvited is the
   wrong kind of magic. The hint is one echo line.
4. **Docs say which mechanism applies when** (the spine's fallback question):
   the Nushell docs page leads with "Homebrew installs: there is nothing to set
   up" and keeps the manual `use` (config.nu or user-autoload file) as the
   fallback for from-source installs and non-brew Nushell builds
   (cargo/MacPorts/nightly — they may not scan the brew prefix; pre-autoload
   Nushell versions lack the mechanism entirely). The README's Nushell section
   gets one clause.
5. **The hand-placed stub from the earlier session is RETIRED by this
   experiment**: deleted before the reinstall, replaced by the brew-managed
   keg-linked file — no rogue files left for a future `brew link` to fight.

## Changes

1. **`dist/nutorch.rb`**: the stub write in `install`; the existence assertion
   in `test do`.
2. **`scripts/install.sh`**: one echo line hinting the user-autoload one-liner.
3. **`website/src/content/docs/nushell.md`**: setup section reframed (autoload
   first, manual fallback second); **`README.md`**: one clause.
4. **Local machine**: hand stub removed; brew-managed stub in its place via the
   reinstall.
5. **Published tap untouched** (next release); no Rust; no `v1/`.

## Verification

1. **The zero-config proof**: after the reinstall, a FRESH
   `nu -c "nutorch
   tensor '[1,2]' | nutorch value"` prints `[1.0,2.0]` with
   no `use` typed and no config edited; `nu -c "nutorch daemon stop"` cleans up.
   The stub exists at
   `$(brew --prefix)/share/nushell/vendor/autoload/nutorch.nu`, brew-linked (a
   symlink into the keg, not a loose file), and references the `opt` path.
2. **brew test green** with the new assertion (temp-copied formula).
3. **Tap hygiene**: local tap git-clean after the revert; the raw published
   formula on GitHub still has no stub (unchanged until next release).
4. **install.sh hint**: present in output; the printed one-liner is valid syntax
   (executed once against a scratch user-autoload dir via `XDG_CONFIG_HOME`
   override or equivalent, then removed).
5. **Docs/site gates**: website build, `check:content`, `check:links` green;
   dprint clean on touched files; no Rust diffs.

**Pass** = all five. **Fail** = the fresh-session proof needs ANY user config,
or brew link fights the stub.

## Result

**Result:** Pass

`brew install nutorch` now seats the module in Nushell by itself — proven by a
fresh session that was never configured.

- **The formula writes the stub**: `share/nushell/vendor/autoload/nutorch.nu`
  containing `use "/opt/homebrew/opt/nutorch/share/nutorch/nutorch.nu" *` — the
  version-stable opt path. The `test do` block asserts the stub exists
  (GPU-free; Nushell itself stays out of the formula's dependencies).
- **The zero-config proof, end to end on this machine**: hand stub removed;
  `dist/nutorch.rb` temp-copied over the local tap;
  `brew reinstall
  --build-from-source` (29s — the stub is install-time output,
  so the pinned v0.1.0 tarball needed no re-release); the stub came out
  BREW-LINKED (a symlink into the keg, not a loose file); then a fresh
  `nu -c "nutorch tensor '[1,2]' | nutorch value"` printed `[1.0,2.0]` with zero
  `use` typed and zero config edited. `brew test` green with the new assertion.
  Local tap reverted to git-clean; the published formula on GitHub still carries
  no stub (next release, per the spine).
- **Bonus from the rebuild**: the earlier hand-applied CLI symlinks (the issue's
  first-draft side effect) were replaced by brew-managed ones — `bin/nutorch` is
  now a proper keg-linked binstub; no rogue files remain anywhere.
- **From-source fallback**: `install.sh` now PRINTS the user-autoload one-liner
  (never writes user config); the printed line was executed once against a
  scratch dir and sources clean.
- **Docs**: the Nushell page leads with "Homebrew installs: there is nothing to
  set up," explains the mechanism in one parenthesis, and keeps the manual
  `use`/user-autoload fallback for non-brew Nushell builds; the README's Nushell
  section carries the autoload clause.
- **Gates**: website build + check:content + check:links + check:ops-ref green;
  dprint clean; zero `.rs` diffs; `v1/` untouched.

## Conclusion

The goal's exact sentence is now true: open a new Nushell, type
`nutorch tensor '[1,2]'`, and it works — with the only `use` statement living in
a file the package owns. The prefix-relative contract held exactly as the spine
argued (both sides derive from `HOMEBREW_PREFIX`), and the fallback story is
documented for everyone outside it. The published tap picks the stub up with the
next release, alongside the MIT metadata and the CLI symlink.
