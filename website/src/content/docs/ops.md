description: 185 ops with PyTorch names, PyTorch argument order, and PyTorch semantics — discoverable from the shell.
order: 4

NuTorch's operation surface is a single declarative table shared by the daemon
and the CLI: **185 ops** spanning creation, pointwise math, linear algebra,
reductions, shape manipulation, indexing, losses, and more.

## PyTorch fidelity

Command names, argument order, defaults, and semantics match PyTorch wherever
possible. If you know `torch.add(a, b, alpha=2)`, you know:

```bash
torch add $a $b --alpha 2
```

```nu
nutorch add $a $b --alpha 2
```

Broadcasting follows PyTorch's rules. Non-broadcastable shapes error with both
shapes named — validation happens in Rust before any GPU call, so error messages
talk about your tensors, not C++ internals.

## Discoverability

```bash
torch ops                # every op: name, category, one-line summary
torch ops --json         # the same as JSON (name, category, summary)
torch mean --help        # usage, parameters, defaults for any op
```

```nu
nutorch ops                             # every op: a native table
nutorch ops | where category == "loss"  # filter natively — no JSON needed
torch mean --help                       # usage, parameters, defaults for any op
```

Every op supports the dual input pattern — pipe the leftmost tensor in or pass
it as an argument (see [tensors](/docs/tensors/)).

## Reference

The full per-op reference is generated from the same table the binaries use, so
it cannot drift: [creation](/docs/reference/creation/),
[pointwise](/docs/reference/pointwise/),

[reduction](/docs/reference/reduction/),
[linear algebra](/docs/reference/linalg/), [shape](/docs/reference/shape/),
[loss](/docs/reference/loss/), [autograd](/docs/reference/autograd/), and
