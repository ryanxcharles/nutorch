### backward

backpropagate from a scalar loss (gradients accumulate)

```bash
torch backward <t1>
```

```nu
torch backward <t1>
```

### grad

snapshot of a tensor's accumulated gradient

```bash
torch grad <t1>
```

```nu
torch grad <t1>
```

### detach

a graph-free reference to the same data

```bash
torch detach <t1>
```

```nu
torch detach <t1>
```

### zero_grad

zero a tensor's accumulated gradient in place

```bash
torch zero_grad <t1>
```

```nu
torch zero_grad <t1>
```
