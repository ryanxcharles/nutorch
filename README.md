# Nutorch

**GPU-accelerated PyTorch tensor operations from any shell.**

Nutorch is **nutorchd**: a standalone daemon that owns a tensor database (backed
by [tch-rs](https://github.com/LaurentMazare/tch-rs) / LibTorch, the C++ engine
behind [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)) and serves thin CLI clients over a Unix
socket. Tensors are referenced by string identifiers, so handles flow through
ordinary pipelines — in bash, zsh, fish, or any other shell.
[Nushell](https://www.nushell.sh/) remains the premium client, with structured
data and native serialization.

**GPU-only, by design.** Every tensor lives on the GPU — that is the point of
the library. There is no device option. **Requires an Apple-silicon Mac** (the
GPU is MPS); the daemon refuses to start without it. Mac-only for now.

```bash
# Working today (PoC):
a=$(torch tensor '[1,2,3]')
b=$(torch tensor '[4,5,6]')
torch add $a $b | torch value
# → [5.0,7.0,9.0]   (computed on the GPU)
```

## The daemon

You never start the daemon — any `torch` command starts it automatically if it
isn't running. It shuts itself down after **1 hour of inactivity** (every tensor
operation renews the lease), so your tensors last long enough to be useful
without holding GPU memory you've stopped using. Tensors live exactly as long as
the daemon — that's the memory-horizon contract.

```bash
torch daemon status      # pid, ttl, idle time, time remaining,
                         # tensor count, memory held, socket, log
torch daemon ttl 4h      # change the idle TTL on the live daemon (none = forever)
torch daemon stop        # shut down now
torch daemon restart     # fresh daemon, empty registry
```

The default TTL is configurable via `NUTORCHD_TTL` (e.g. `30m`, `2h`, `none`).

Run `torch ops` to list every available operation, and `torch <op> --help` for
any one of them.

## Neural networks

Modules are daemon-resident objects with `nn://` handles, composed and run from
the shell:

```bash
l=$(torch nn linear 2 3)                         # PyTorch-default init, seeded
m=$(torch nn sequential $l "$(torch nn relu)")   # consumes the child handles
y=$(torch forward $m $x)                         # or: $x | torch forward $m
torch nn parameters $m                           # tensor:// handles — LIVE views
torch nn info $m
```

Module kinds:
`linear conv1d conv2d conv_transpose2d embedding layer_norm
batch_norm group_norm dropout relu sigmoid tanh gelu leaky_relu softmax
max_pool2d avg_pool2d flatten sequential`;
optimizers: `sgd adam adamw
rmsprop` (see `torch nn <kind> --help`-style usage
errors for each). `torch nn train|eval $m` switches dropout/batch_norm behavior.

Save and load a model's state (safetensors — PyTorch-interchangeable, including
buffers): `torch nn save $m model.safetensors`, then
`torch nn load $fresh model.safetensors` into a same-architecture module.

Losses are ordinary ops: `torch mse_loss $pred $target | torch backward` (also
`cross_entropy`, `l1_loss`, `binary_cross_entropy_with_logits`, … — see
`torch ops` under `loss`).

Parameter handles alias the module's weights (the live-view contract): gradients
populate through them after `backward`, and optimizer steps (coming in this
issue) will be visible through them. Pretrained weights load at construction:
`torch nn linear 2 3 --weight $w --bias-tensor $b` (deep-copied; your tensors
are never mutated).

## Autograd

Gradients flow through any pipeline — libtorch records the graph automatically
once a tensor requires them:

```bash
w=$(torch randn '[3]' --requires_grad)
loss=$(torch mul $w $w | torch sum)
torch backward $loss            # gradients ACCUMULATE across calls
torch grad $w | torch value     # a snapshot: later backwards won't change it
torch zero_grad $w              # reset; grad now reads as zeros
d=$(torch detach $w)            # graph-free reference (stops tracking)
```

Rules of the road: `backward` needs a scalar loss (reduce first) on a tensor
that requires gradients; `grad` before any backward is an error; rebuilding the
graph (re-running the pipeline) before each backward is required — a second
backward through the SAME graph errors, as in PyTorch. Graph lifetime: freeing
an intermediate's handle is safe (the graph holds the tensor internally until
the graph itself dies), but keep your LEAF handles — they are the only key to
their gradients. `torch tensors` counts only registry handles; graph-held
storage is invisible to it.

## Nushell

A generated module gives Nushell native structured data over the same daemon —
and with a Homebrew install it AUTOLOADS: new Nushell sessions have `nutorch`
commands with zero setup (`torch nu-module | save -f nutorch.nu` regenerates the
module; a current copy is committed at the repo root):

```nu
use nutorch.nu *

let t = ([[1 2] [3 4]] | nutorch tensor)
$t | nutorch mm $t | nutorch value            # a native table
nutorch tensors | where bytes > 1_000_000 | get handle | each {|h| nutorch free $h }
```

Wrappers are pipeline-first (the first tensor slot is `$in`); non-finite values
cross the boundary as REAL Nushell NaN/infinity floats (the JSON dialect is
handled for you). The structured verbs also serve plain JSON anywhere via
`--json`: `torch tensors --json`, `torch ops --json`, `torch nn info $m --json`,
`torch daemon status --json`. See `scripts/train-regression.nu` for a full
training loop in Nushell.

## Saving tensors and reclaiming memory

Handles are typed strings — `tensor://<id>` today, with `nn://` (modules) and
`optim://` (optimizers) arriving in issue 0009 — so a handle in a script or a
log always says what it refers to, and using the wrong kind is a named error
rather than a mystery.

Tensors live exactly as long as the daemon (default idle TTL: 1 hour).
Persistence is shell redirection — export the tensors you care about, never the
intermediates:

```bash
torch value --meta $w > w.json          # export (dtype travels inside)
w=$(torch tensor "$(cat w.json)")       # re-import, dtype preserved
```

Reclaim memory selectively or wholesale:

```bash
torch tensors            # list: handle, shape, dtype, bytes, age, idle
torch free $t1 $t2       # free specific tensors (or pipe handles in)
torch free --all         # empty the registry
torch daemon restart     # the coarse valve: export, restart, re-import
```

Note: JSON has no NaN/Infinity, so `torch value` writes the string tokens
`"NaN"`, `"Infinity"`, and `"-Infinity"` for non-finite values, and
`torch tensor` reads them back — round-trips are lossless.

## Installing

With [Homebrew](https://brew.sh) (Apple silicon):

```bash
brew tap nutorch/nutorch
brew trust nutorch/nutorch   # brew 6.0+ requires trusting third-party taps
brew install nutorch
```

A prebuilt bottle pours in seconds where one matches your macOS; otherwise brew
builds from the release tarball (needs Rust, ~1 minute). The CLI answers to both
names — `torch` (PyTorch muscle memory) and `nutorch` (a symlink to the same
binary, from the next release). The formula's source of truth is
`dist/nutorch.rb`; the tap lives at
[nutorch/homebrew-nutorch](https://github.com/nutorch/homebrew-nutorch).

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/nutorch/nutorch
cd nutorch
scripts/bootstrap.sh     # venv + torch 2.11.0 + release build (idempotent)
scripts/install.sh       # → ~/.nutorch (or pass a prefix); add ~/.nutorch/bin to PATH
torch --version
```

The installed binaries are relocatable: libtorch's required dylibs are copied
into the prefix and resolved by a baked relative rpath — no environment
variables, no checkout needed at runtime.

## Status

**Proof of concept working** (issue 0002): daemon, thin client, six ops
(`tensor`, `full`, `add`, `mm`, `mean`, `value`), exact GPU results from plain
bash. The architecture is being worked out in the open — see the issue tracker
at [issues/README.md](issues/README.md) and the agent contract / vision in
[AGENTS.md](AGENTS.md).

## v1: the proof of concept

Nutorch began as a Nushell plugin — 40 PyTorch operations, GPU acceleration
(CPU/CUDA/MPS), autograd, and neural-network training, all from the Nushell
command line. It proved the core idea that carries v2: tensors stay in a
Rust-owned registry, and the shell passes string handles through pipelines.

v1 is archived, frozen, and fully working in [`v1/`](v1/):

- [v1/README.md](v1/README.md) — user documentation, installation, demos
  (including screenshots in `v1/raw-images/`)
- [v1/AGENTS.md](v1/AGENTS.md) — the v1 architecture record
- [v1/TODO.md](v1/TODO.md) — v1 implementation status and quality tracking

The original pre-archive layout is available at the git tag `v1-final`.
